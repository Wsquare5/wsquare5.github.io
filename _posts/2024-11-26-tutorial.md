# Lessons Learned for Jekyll

Today is a big day! I’ve finally set up my personal website (special thanks to my friend [Veronica](https://veronicaotherworld.github.io/) ! This milestone has motivated me to start posting my study notes and thoughts. I firmly believe that learning by sharing and creating outputs is the most effective way to internalize knowledge.

>Here are some challenges I encountered while setting up the website and what I learned from them:

- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Don’t forget to navigate to Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment and set the source to `GitHub Actions`.

- **Using a Dev Container**: I tried the development container feature in VS Code for the first time, and it’s amazing! I plan to keep using it for future projects.

- **Base URL Configuration**: I overlooked the `baseurl` setting in the `_config.yml` file, which caused issues and took me a while to debug.

- **Post Title Format**: To display posts on the site, make sure the file name includes the date in the correct format.

- **Generate the icon kit**: Follow the chirpy official tutorial and download the zip file from  [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) according to the comments below. The cute avocado icon is from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/avocado" title="avocado icons">Avocado icons created by vectorsmarket15 - Flaticon</a>.
